Consider the following quote:

“An article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.” - Claerbout and Karrenbach, Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics. 1992

This quote highlights a central tenet of the open science movement, namely that researchers doing computational work need to share their code and data to allow replication of their results and to more clearly demonstrate their methods. But sharing is not yet commonplace, in part due to technical impediments. Typical problems have to do with reproducing the computing environment in which the code was used and include operating system dependencies, software version incompatibilities, and dependencies on proprietary components.
