This lesson assumes you have the R, RStudio, LaTex and Zotero installed on your computer. Install the following:

1. R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

2. RStudio is an environment for developing using R.
It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You will need the Desktop version for your computer.

3. RStudio will provide it's own version of `pandoc` -- the tool used to convert documents from markdown to other formats -- when you install it, but when we create `PDF` versions of our documents, `pandoc` depends on `LaTex`. Install `LaTex` for your OS here: <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>

4. For the Zotero examples to work, install Zotero <https://www.zotero.org/download/> and the Better Bib(La)Tex for Zotero Plugin <https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/wiki>. Zotero plugins are essentially Firefox plugins, so if you download and open the `.xpi` file Firefox will open and you can install the plugin. Get the latest xpi file from here <https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/tag/1.6.100>.
