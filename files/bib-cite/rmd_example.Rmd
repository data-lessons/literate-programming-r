```{r sec_3}
x <- rnorm(1000)
head(x)
```

`knitr` offers a lot of control over representing different
types of output. We can also have inline `R` expressions
computed on the fly.

The mean $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$ of the
`r length(x)` random variates we generated is
`r round(mean(x), 3)`.

This figure is computed on-the-fly as well. No more
copy-paste, including for figures:

```{r sec_4}
plot(density(x))
```
