## Exploring a complete knitr document

In this section we'll retrieve a complete project stored in a GitHub repository and take a close look
at how formatted. We'll beging by creating a new project in RStudio.  


**Instructions**
# Connect to RStudio server at rstudio http://35.203.43.213:8787
# Select Project (upper right corner)
# Choose New Project
# Choose Version Control
# Choose Git
# Enter the following Repository URL: https://github.com/hdekk/midlife
# Click the Create Project button

### Activity 1
Using the Files tab in RStudio, locate the file 2-Midlife-Crisis-paper.rmd and open it in the editor.
Once you have the file open, browse the first few lines.
Next, run the the first four code chunks by clicking on the green arrows in the upper right corner of 
each chunk. Watch what happens in the environment tab. Click on each data object name in the environment
tab and view the data.

### Activity 2
Below the fourth code block is a long section of LaTeX. This section is needed to recreate the layout 
used in the original paper because it includes formatting that markdown is unable to do. Note that 
LaTeX markup can be added to our RMarkdown document without having to insert a code block. Knitr
automatically knows how to handle it. It's also possible to embed LaTeX markup within regular text.
Scroll down to line 224 to see an example of this.  Can you see anything different about the markup 
when it's embedded inline?

### Activity 3
Now, let's run the rest of the code chunks. You'll notice that some produce outputs. You can clear 
this output by clicking on the x in the upper right corner of the output box.

### Activity 4
Let's knit the document. You may have to turn your popup blocker off to allow the pdf viewer to open.
Compare the final pdf to the RMarkdown code. Is it clear what the code is producing. Are there any question?
