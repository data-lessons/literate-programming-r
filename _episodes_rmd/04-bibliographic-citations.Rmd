## Defining your bibliography

Out of the box, RStudio and Knitr use the built-in citation rendering that pandoc provides. We set this in the `YAML` header information at the top of our R Markdown document. Pandoc can read a bibliographic file in various formats, including: MODS, BibLaTex, BibTex, RIS, EndNote, MEDLINE, etc. These are formats that provide a structured way to store a list of references. Let's take a look at the BibTex file we provided for this workshop:

```{bash, eval=F}
head -n 10 decoupling-dns.bib
```

We see elements of an reference entry: `@Article` is the type, `darwin` is citation-key, and other more elements of a reference. To tell RStudio to use our BibTex file we add `bibliography` key to our document header.

```

This will read `decoupling-dns.bib` file and use to create citations and a bibliography for our file when we render it using our `Knit` button. Let's walk through what that looks like. 

## Creating a Citation

The actually cite one of our bibtex entries we use the `@` symbol in a couple of ways.  To maek a citation use the following: 

```
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We motivate the need for
vacuum tubes. We place our work in context with the related work in this
area [@darwin].
```

>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We motivate the need for
vacuum tubes. We place our work in context with the related work in this
area [@darwin].

## Placement of the Bibliography

Notice that when we knitted the document, a bibliography was added to the end of the document at the end. We should probably add an appropriate header to the end of the document.

```
## References
```
Now when we knit again our bibliography will be added below the Reference header. 

## Multi-author citations

Ok let's add a multi-author citation to the mix. We'll pull another quote from our dummy paper and add three citation-keys from our bibliography file separated by a semi-colon inside brackets. We can Knit again. 

```
Another compelling aim in this area is the visualization of evolutionary
programming. Unfortunately, trainable epistemologies might not be the
panacea that end-users expected. Next, it should be noted that Nag
studies reliable archetypes [@nehru; @dennis05; @chomsky].
```

panacea that end-users expected. Next, it should be noted that Nag
studies reliable archetypes [@nehru; @dennis05; @chomsky].

Notice that more references were added to our bibliography and sorted by alpha. 

## What about page numbers? 

We need to add page numbers and chapters with a comma following our citation-keys like so: 

```
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We motivate the need for
vacuum tubes. We place our work in context with the related work in this
area [@darwin, pp. 3-5].
```

>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We motivate the need for
vacuum tubes. We place our work in context with the related work in this
area [@darwin, pp. 3-5].

We can do this in a multi-author context as well: 

```
Another compelling aim in this area is the visualization of evolutionary
programming. Unfortunately, trainable epistemologies might not be the
panacea that end-users expected. Next, it should be noted that Nag
studies reliable archetypes [@nehru, pp. 4-6; @dennis05; @chomsky, ch. 1].
```

>Another compelling aim in this area is the visualization of evolutionary
programming. Unfortunately, trainable epistemologies might not be the
panacea that end-users expected. Next, it should be noted that Nag
studies reliable archetypes [@nehru, pp. 4-6; @dennis05; @chomsky, ch. 1].

## Omitting the author's name

We can also omit the author's name in the citation by using the minus sign `-`. 

```
Dennis proposed a “smart” tool for synthesizing 802.11b, which he call Nag [-@dennis05].
```

Dennis proposed a “smart” tool for synthesizing 802.11b, which he call Nag [-@dennis05].

## In-text citation style 

We also can use in-text style citations: 

```
@dekker03 [p. 33] suggested a scheme for enabling “smart” configurations, but
did not fully realize the implications of forward-error correction at
the time.
```
@dekker03 [p. 33] suggested a scheme for enabling “smart” configurations, but
did not fully realize the implications of forward-error correction at
the time.

## Adding uncited items

Adding references to your bibliography you don't site. We can use some special syntax to add items to our references that we aren't going to cite in the paper: 

```
---
nocite: | 
  @qian, @minsky
...
```
---
nocite: | 
  @qian, @minsky
...

## Using Zotero 

Now we have the basics down, let's think about our bibliography file again. Bibtex is nice and provides structure so a machine can read it, but we don't really want to write it ourself. We can let Zotero do that for us and export BibTex file as needed into our R project. We also can use the Zotero Better BibTex plugin to auto-save that BibTex bibliography to our project. Unfortunately, this plugin is broken for Zotero 5 and currently only works in 4. However, they are working on it. Regardless, using Zotero mean that we can use the more user friendly tool to create and mantain references and use that in our project so R can consume.

## Citr - An Easier Way to Add Citations

The simulation of virtual communication has been widely studied. This
approach is less expensive than ours. On a similar note, recent work by
Anderson and Raman [@moore; @thomas; @williams] suggests a system for evaluating
interactive technology, but does not offer an implementation.
Contrarily, these solutions are entirely orthogonal to our efforts.


>The seminal methodology by Thomas et al. [@dekker03; @jackson; @minsky] does not provide
multicast methodologies as well as our method. On a similar note, Raman
and Smith suggested a scheme for enabling “smart” configurations, but
did not fully realize the implications of forward-error correction at
the time . Unlike many prior approaches, we do not
attempt to manage or request the development of DHCP. a litany of
existing work supports our use of Smalltalk.
